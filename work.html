                                In this project I was presented with design files for the desktop version in AdobeXD. I worked on adapting the design for mobile screen sizes and then coded the site to be responsive on all sizes in-between. By request of the client, the site was exclusively created using only html and css with just a couple of small js functions for rollover logo and a read more feature.

                                 This was an interactive art project. The illustration of the insects in the collection box was completed in Adobe Illustrator. The interactive portion is a separate illustrator file with each of the boxes as a separate layer and saved as a svg file. The light switch image was exported as an svg as well. In this way each “box”, or switch can be manipulated through css and jquery. It is imperative that the collection box illustration, and the shaded box illustration line up perfectly. I was able to achieve this for desktop, and will be working on it in to improve responsiveness for different screen sizes. Here is the working page link:
